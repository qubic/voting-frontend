# Clarification on the Qubic listing in GateUS

Qubic is currently listed and available for trading in the United States through Gate.US, a licensed exchange platform operating across several U.S. jurisdictions.

We've been invited to join their NextUp program, a marketing and liquidity initiative designed to boost visibility and trading activity for listed projects.

The program requires providing $100K worth of Qubic, which goes directly to Gate.US users through promotional activities, not to the exchange itself.

Participation in NextUp is described as voluntary. There are no guarantees on permanent listing with or without NextUp campaign but in theory, contribution to the NextUp campaign could decrease our chances of delisting.

## 🧩 About NextUp

NextUp is a marketing and liquidity exposure program by Gate.US that highlights listed tokens and promotes them among U.S. users.

## 💬 TL;DR

• Qubic is listed on Gate.US and now is available for trading

• NextUp is a marketing initiative, not a fee, but activity affects listing status

• Participation is "voluntary," yet engagement likely determines long-term inclusion

• The decision to join NextUp program rests with the community.

We're asking the community to react with a ✅ or ❌ to express whether you support moving forward with this NextUp participation. The funds would be taken from the exchanges fund
