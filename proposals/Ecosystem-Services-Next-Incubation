## Options

**Option 0) Derivatives DEX**  
**Option 1) Qubic EVM**

---

### Option 0: Futures / Derivatives DEX  
A platform where users can trade perpetual contracts without intermediaries.  
- These contracts function like futures but have no expiry date, enabling traders to hold leveraged positions indefinitely.  
- Smart contracts manage custody, margining, liquidations, and funding payments transparently and automatically.  
- This makes the system non-custodial, accessible to anyone with a wallet, and resistant to centralized risks.  

### Option 1: Qubic EVM  
This would allow the deployment of Solidity code to create mini dApps, primarily for DeFi, to increase the use of QX.  
- Native dApps on Qubic would still require IPOs.  
- It’s a complex project to execute because it requires deep expertise in Qubic, the EVM, and the tooling of both systems.
